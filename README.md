# Diabetes and throid Prediction Models

This repository contains predictive models for diagnosing diabetes and thyroid conditions. The models are developed using data mining techniques, specifically focusing on the Naive Bayes classification algorithm.

## Project Structure

### Diabetes Prediction
- **diabetes_data.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing the diabetes prediction model. It contains relevant medical data related to diabetes.
- **diabetes_prediction2.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, model training, and evaluation for predicting diabetes. This notebook outlines the steps taken to preprocess the data, build the Naive Bayes model, and evaluate its performance.
- **diabetes_prediction_model.pkl**: The saved Naive Bayes model for predicting diabetes. This model can be loaded and used to make predictions on new data.

### Thyroid Prediction
- **hypothyroid.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing the thyroid prediction model. It contains relevant medical data related to hypothyroidism.
- **thyroid_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, model training, and evaluation for predicting thyroid conditions. This notebook outlines the steps taken to preprocess the data, build the Naive Bayes model, and evaluate its performance.
- **thyroid_prediction_model.pkl**: The saved Naive Bayes model for predicting thyroid conditions. This model can be loaded and used to make predictions on new data.

### Miscellaneous
- **.ipynb_checkpoints**: Directory automatically created by Jupyter to store checkpoint files.
